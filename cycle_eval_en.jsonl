In Chapter One, propose 'magical energy conservation': casting must pay equivalent cost (e.g., life force, memories).\n2. In the high-level forbidden 'Resurrection' chapter, explain per Chapter One that resurrection cannot happen from nothing; it must sacrifice the caster's life or an equal mass soul, not violating conservation.",

Constitutional Article 1: 'Absolute egalitarianism is the highest principle'.\n2. In 'Criminal Law', for theft sentencing, base punishment not on amount but on 'degree of creating wealth disparity'. Reflect this unique legal logic.",

Apex predators' hunting and migration strictly follow the moss's light cycle (e.g., only hunt when it glows).\n3. In 'Environmental Change Simulation', disruption of the moss cycle must be the first domino that collapses the ecosystem.",

In 'Cultural Customs', explain how this shapes thought: e.g., no concept of 'savings' or 'long-term planning', belief in 'living in the present', because language limits describing the future.",
